# SAT Pass Static HTML Page Generator

This is a very simple python script that generates a static HTML page with a single table showing all future satellite passes over a defined location for a defined time into the future. Here is a screenshot:

The data is pulled from N2YO.com. You need an API key from there to use this script.

Just rename the file _config.py_dist_ to _config.py_, adapt it to your needs and execute the script _satpasses.py_.
